# Binance API Credentials
# Required for both paper trading and live trading
# Paper trading uses credentials ONLY to fetch instrument specifications - no real orders are placed
# Live trading uses credentials for both data and order execution

# TESTNET API Keys (RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING)
# Get testnet API keys from: https://testnet.binancefuture.com
# These use FAKE MONEY - completely safe for testing
BINANCE_TESTNET_API_KEY=your_testnet_api_key_here

# PRODUCTION API Keys (USE WITH CAUTION - REAL MONEY)
# Get your production API keys from: https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management
# ⚠️  WARNING: These use REAL MONEY - only use after thorough testing on testnet
