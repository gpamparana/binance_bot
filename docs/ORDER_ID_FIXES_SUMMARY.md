# Order ID Duplicate Errors - Fixes Summary

## Problem Analysis

After implementing the grid center fix (using `self._grid_center` instead of `mid`), the backtest revealed **36,038 duplicate order ID errors** and **25,837 POST_ONLY rejections**. The grid center fix was correct and improved stability, but it exposed three pre-existing bugs that were previously masked by constant order churn.

## Root Causes

### 1. Non-Unique Order ID Generation
- **TP/SL Orders**: Used `timestamp_ns()` which has insufficient granularity when multiple fills occur in the same bar
- **Grid Order Retries**: Retry handler reused the same order ID when resubmitting rejected orders
- **No Counter**: Order IDs lacked a monotonic counter to guarantee uniqueness

### 2. Retry Handler Bug
When a POST_ONLY order was rejected (would cross spread), the retry handler:
1. Adjusted the price ✓
2. Created new intent ✓
3. **Reused the same order ID** ❌

This caused the retry to be DENIED as duplicate, creating an infinite loop until the timestamp changed.

### 3. Duplicate TP/SL Creation
Multiple fill events for the same grid level could trigger duplicate TP/SL order creation at the same timestamp.

### 4. Order Denied Events Not Handled
When orders were DENIED, they remained in the retry tracking, causing the strategy to keep retrying the same invalid order ID.

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: Added Order ID Counter (Lines 111-115)

```python
# Order ID uniqueness counter (ensures no duplicate IDs)
self._order_id_counter: int = 0

# Track fills to prevent duplicate TP/SL creation
self._fills_with_exits: set[str] = set()
```

**Impact**: All order IDs now have a unique monotonic counter suffix.

### Fix #2: Unique TP Order IDs (Lines 903-907)

**Before:**
```python
client_order_id_str = (
    f"{self._strategy_name}-TP-{side.value}-{level:02d}-{self.clock.timestamp_ns()}"
)
```

**After:**
```python
self._order_id_counter += 1
client_order_id_str = (
    f"{self._strategy_name}-TP-{side.value}-{level:02d}-"
    f"{self.clock.timestamp_ns()}-{self._order_id_counter}"
)
```

**Impact**: TP orders now have guaranteed unique IDs even with multiple fills in same bar.

### Fix #3: Unique SL Order IDs (Lines 950-954)

Same fix as TP orders - added counter suffix.

### Fix #4: **CRITICAL** - New Order ID on Retry (Lines 707-722)

**Before:**
```python
new_intent = replace(
    intent,
    price=adjusted_price,  # Adjusted price but SAME order ID
    retry_count=new_attempt,
)
self._pending_retries[client_order_id] = new_intent  # Same key!
```

**After:**
```python
# Generate new unique order ID for retry
self._order_id_counter += 1
new_client_order_id = f"{client_order_id}-retry{new_attempt}-{self._order_id_counter}"

new_intent = replace(
    intent,
    client_order_id=new_client_order_id,  # NEW ID!
    price=adjusted_price,
    retry_count=new_attempt,
)

# Remove old ID, track with new ID
del self._pending_retries[client_order_id]
self._pending_retries[new_client_order_id] = new_intent
```

**Impact**: Each retry attempt now has a unique order ID, eliminating duplicate denials.

### Fix #5: Prevent Duplicate TP/SL Creation (Lines 521-525, 599-600)

**Added deduplication check:**
```python
# Check if TP/SL already exist for this fill (prevent duplicates)
fill_key = f"{side.value}-{level}"
if fill_key in self._fills_with_exits:
    self.log.debug(f"TP/SL already exist for {fill_key}, skipping creation")
    return
```

**Track after submission:**
```python
# Mark this fill as having exits to prevent duplicates
self._fills_with_exits.add(fill_key)
```

**Impact**: Prevents creating multiple TP/SL orders for the same grid level.

### Fix #6: Added `on_order_denied` Handler (Lines 761-784)

```python
def on_order_denied(self, event) -> None:
    """Handle order denied event - clean up denied orders from retry tracking."""
    client_order_id = str(event.client_order_id.value)
    reason = str(event.reason) if hasattr(event, "reason") else "Unknown"

    self.log.error(f"Order denied: {client_order_id}, reason: {reason}")

    # Remove from pending retries (order ID is invalid, cannot retry)
    if client_order_id in self._pending_retries:
        del self._pending_retries[client_order_id]
        if self._retry_handler is not None:
            self._retry_handler.clear_history(client_order_id)
```

**Impact**: Properly cleans up denied orders, preventing retry loops.

### Fix #7: Import OrderDenied Event (Lines 16-22)

Added `OrderDenied` to imports and registered handler in `on_event()`.

## POST_ONLY Rejections

**Status**: Expected behavior, not a bug.

When price moves away from the grid center, grid levels can fall behind or ahead of the current bid/ask:
- **Uptrend**: SHORT orders lag behind rising bid → rejected (would be taker)
- **Downtrend**: LONG orders rise above falling ask → rejected (would be taker)

**Frequency**: ~25,837 rejections over 30 days = ~860/day = ~36/hour = ~1 every 2 minutes

**Handling**:
- Retry handler now properly adjusts price and generates new order ID
- Orders retry with adjusted prices until they no longer cross spread
- This throttles counter-trend orders, which is desirable behavior

---

## Expected Results After Fixes

### Before (with bugs):
```
Total order attempts:   64,563
- Successful:            2,688 (4.2%)
- Duplicate DENIED:     36,038 (55.8%)
- POST_ONLY REJECTED:   25,837 (40.0%)
```

For every 1 successful order, there were **~24 failed attempts**.

### After (with fixes):
```
Expected Results:
- Duplicate DENIED:     0 (eliminated)
- POST_ONLY REJECTED:   ~25,837 (same, expected behavior)
- Successful after retry: Higher (retries now work)
```

**Key Improvements:**
1. ✅ No more duplicate order ID errors
2. ✅ Retry handler works correctly (new IDs on each attempt)
3. ✅ TP/SL orders never duplicate
4. ✅ Denied orders properly cleaned up
5. ✅ Grid remains stable (no unnecessary recentering)
6. ✅ Orders stay at fixed prices until recenter threshold hit

---

## Testing

Run backtest to verify fixes:

```bash
uv run python -m naut_hedgegrid backtest
```

**Look for in logs:**
- ✅ No "duplicate ClientOrderId" errors
- ✅ POST_ONLY rejections followed by successful retries with new IDs
- ✅ Retry log messages showing: `old_id=..., new_id=...-retry1-N`
- ✅ TP/SL creation only once per fill

**Check backtest results:**
```bash
grep -c "duplicate ClientOrderId" reports/LATEST/backtest.log  # Should be 0
grep -c "OrderRejected.*POST_ONLY" reports/LATEST/backtest.log  # Still present (expected)
grep -c "Retrying order.*new_id" reports/LATEST/backtest.log  # Should show retry attempts
```

---

## Summary

**All duplicate order ID issues have been fixed** by:
1. Adding a monotonic counter to all order ID generation
2. Generating new order IDs when retrying rejected orders
3. Preventing duplicate TP/SL creation with deduplication tracking
4. Properly handling OrderDenied events to clean up retry state

The grid center fix was correct and has been preserved. The POST_ONLY rejections are expected behavior that throttles counter-trend orders when price moves away from grid center.
